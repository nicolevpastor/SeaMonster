A page where it is designed to display several games, funded or not. When the user hops on, they are introduced 
with the game cards and helpful features, such as being able to search and use the filtering options to see funded
and unfunded games only. The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.

## Notes📝
 I think with a website, one of the most important things to ensure is accessibility. Therefore, I made sure I used contrasting colors, with blues and text in white. The text on the website is aligned and centered. Adding in more CSS rules and customizing each of the headers was also done. The light-up effect when hovering over is added as well. I made sure the buttons work, to show the cards that apply to. I included the totals on the cards to display information that can be helpful to the user. I also included a navigation bar, which displays Home, About, and Games, so when clicked, it smooth scrolls to the desired section by the user. I also included a search bar with a button where you can hover and change colors. The user can type and either enter or click the button, and information about the desired game will pop up. A note for myself that I will continue working on is adding in more accessibility features, with websites I'd create, I'd like to implement a way to use voice audio to pronounce the description as well.

## Challenges🌟
One challenge was going back to see what I did wrong, and trying to find more and more articles and videos that could help me achieve what was needed. The little errors were hard to catch. I came across concepts of JavaScript that took me a while to understand, but either way, it was great to challenge myself in doing more. I came across a lot of difficulties with my VSCode, pushing my code onto this repo, as my VSCode kept denying it. I have my other Github account I use for my submissions of assignments, and still figuring why it connects with this account when I pushed the code, making it a collaborator.
